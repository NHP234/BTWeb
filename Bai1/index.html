                <h3>Ja 3 "Spooky Season"</h3>
                <p>Every time Ja steps on the court, it's showtime. To help him elevate his game, we worked with him to make the bounciest Ja signature shoe so far. The Ja 3 is light, tough and a game-changer with full-length Hybrid ZoomX foam. “ZoomX is crazy responsive,” Ja says. “I call it that jet fuel.” We call it bad news for his defenders.</p>

                <h3>Air Jordan 4 Retro "Cave Stone and Black"</h3>
                <p>Step into a classic. This AJ4 throws it back with full-grain leather and premium textiles. Iconic design elements from the original, like floating eyestays and mesh-inspired accents, feel just as fresh as they did in '89.</p>

                <h3>KD18 "Slim Reaper"</h3>
                <p>It's always spooky SZN when the Slim Reaper is on the prowl, dishing out 30-point performances to defenders who never see it coming. Featuring a glow-in-the-dark outsole and a mysterious, slender skeleton hand design across the midfoot cage, this special KD18 pays tribute to one of the most intimidating scorers to ever haunt the perimeter, always lurking for his next bucket.</p>
